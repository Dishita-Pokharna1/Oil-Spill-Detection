## 🔍 Overview

Oil spills are one of the most destructive marine disasters — harming ecosystems, threatening wildlife, and costing millions.  
Traditional detection methods are often **delayed, expensive, or inefficient**.

**Our Solution?**  
A real-time web platform that detects oil spills from satellite imagery using RGB-based analysis and Machine Learning. The system immediately **alerts authorities**, visualizes affected areas, and integrates environmental forecasting for next-level decision-making.

## 🧠 How It Works!
![Final Section](./Screenshot%202025-06-05%20015420.png)






Detection Logic
Compares image’s pixel data using RGB difference threshold.

Threshold: ΔRGB > 1 ➝ potential anomaly.

ML model trained on small annotated image samples fine-tunes the accuracy.


📦 Installation & Setup
🔧 Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start
🎨 Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000 — or even better, use the live hosted link if available.
🖼️ Sample Input
Upload a 16×16 satellite image.

📈 Future Scope
